## Usage

In Cerebro, type `steam` to see all your installed steam games. Start them with <kbd>↩</kbd>.

Want to look for a specific game? Start typing either the game's name, path or even regex to find it!

Games that you played started using Cerebro filter up to the top, otherwise the list is sorted by name.

## Known issues
- Untested on other platforms than Windows
- Hardcoded path to steam folder makes it only work on 64-bit Windows for now without manual modification
